Welcome to the Wachat API! Our REST API allows you to programmatically send messages, manage your WhatsApp instances, and integrate Wachat directly into your own applications.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to the following base URL:

```bash
https://app.wachat.net/api/v1
```
### Authentication

The Wachat API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in your Wachat dashboard.

Authentication to the API is performed via HTTP Bearer Auth. Provide your API key as the bearer token in the Authorization header of your request.
<CodeGroup>
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN
</CodeGroup>
<Note>
Keep your API keys secure! Do not share them in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, or public forums. If your key is compromised, regenerate it immediately from your dashboard.
</Note>
