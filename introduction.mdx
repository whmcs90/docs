Welcome to the Wachat API! Our REST API allows you to programmatically send messages, manage your WhatsApp instances, and integrate Wachat directly into your own applications.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to the following base URL:

```text
[https://app.wachat.net/api/v1](https://app.wachat.net/api/v1)

<Tip>
💡 Pro Tip: Testing from these Docs

You can use the "Try It" feature on the right side of any API endpoint in this documentation! Simply paste your token into the authentication field once, and it will be remembered as you navigate through different endpoints.
