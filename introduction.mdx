## Welcome to Wachat API Documentation 📘

The **Wachat API** is a high-level messaging solution designed to help you integrate WhatsApp capabilities into your business workflow seamlessly. Built as a robust wrapper over the Evolution API, it simplifies instance management, messaging, and group controls.

## 🔐 Authentication

All API requests to Wachat must be authenticated using a secret token. This token identifies your team and ensures your requests are linked to your specific subscription plan and instances.

### 🛡️ API Token

To identify your requests, you must include your API Token in the **HTTP Header** of every request.

| Header Name | Header Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| `x-api-token` | `YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN` |

<Warning>
  **Keep your token secret!** Your API Token carries full access to your WhatsApp instances and messaging quota. Never share it in public repositories (like GitHub) or client-side code that can be inspected by users.
</Warning>

### 📍 How to find your API Token

1. Login to your [Wachat Dashboard](https://app.wachat.net).
2. Navigate to the **Settings** or **API Management** section.
3. Click on **Copy** or **Generate New Token**.
4. Use this token in the header of your requests.

## 💡 Pro Tip: Testing from this Docs

<Tip>
  You can use the **"Try It"** feature on the right side of any API endpoint in this documentation!

  Simply paste your `x-api-token` into the authentication field once, and it will be remembered as you navigate through different endpoints. This allows you to verify your instance state or send test messages without writing a single line of code.
