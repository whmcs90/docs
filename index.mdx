Welcome to the official Wachat developer documentation. Whether you are building an automated customer support bot, sending notifications, or managing group chats, our API provides the tools you need to build powerful communication flows.
## 🔐 Authentication

All API requests to Wachat must be authenticated using a secret token. This token identifies your team and ensures your requests are linked to your specific subscription plan and instances.

### API Token
To interact with our endpoints, you must include your API Token in the HTTP header of every request.
<Warning>
Keep your token secret! Your API Token carries full access to your WhatsApp instances and messaging quota. Never share it in public repositories (like GitHub) or client-side code that can be inspected by users.
</Warning>

## Getting Started

Explore our guides and API reference to start sending messages in minutes.

<Tip>
💡 Pro Tip: Testing from these Docs

You can use the "Try It" feature on the right side of any API endpoint in this documentation! Simply paste your token into the authentication field once, and it will be remembered as you navigate through different endpoints.
